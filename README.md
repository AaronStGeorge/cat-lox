# poo-pl
A a ðŸ’©ier dialect of the [Money](https://interpreterbook.com/#the-monkey-programming-language) programming language, as described in Thorsten Ball's excellent [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). Implemented in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) rather than go.

Goals
- [ ] Implement using the rust language.
- [ ] Reasonable code coverage.
- [ ] Use no outside libraries.
- [ ] ðŸ’©y syntax (e.g. unicode support).
- [ ] Create a program in poo-pl that computes 100th prime number.

There is no intention of creating an industrial strength language implementation, this is a hobby project only.
