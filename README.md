# poo-pl
A a shittier dialect of the [Money](https://interpreterbook.com/#the-monkey-programming-language)programming language. This is me working through Thorsten Ball's excellent [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). Go buy it!

Goals
- [ ] Implement using the rust language.
- [ ] Full code coverage.
- [ ] Use no outside libraries.
- [ ] ðŸ’©y syntax.
- [ ] Create a program in poo-pl that computes 100 digits of Ï€.

There is no intention of creating an industrial strength language implementation, this is a hobby project only.
