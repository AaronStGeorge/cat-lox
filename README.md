A tree-walk interpreter for a dialect of the
[Lox](http://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) programming
language, as described in part two of Bob Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting
Interpreters](https://http://craftinginterpreters.com/). Implemented in
[rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). The code is somewhat rough, this is
my first rust project. It's also severely under-documented, but then again
one can always read the [book](https://http://craftinginterpreters.com/) ðŸ˜‰.

This is not and was never intended to be an industrial strength language
implementation, it's a hobby project implemented for fun and learning. Just
in case it's not obviousâ€”don't use this for anything you want to work well.
